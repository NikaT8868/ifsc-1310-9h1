    <h2>SpaceX Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>I have been always fascinated by good looking and well-designed websites and this course provided a great learning opportunity for me to know more about how this can be done.  Before this course, I did not know much about using HTML and CSS together to create a website. This is great that HTML files can be linked to CSS files to change the appearance, and how the appearance of the website was so easily separable from the structure in the HTML by linking CSS files to the HTML files. Also, I found the written summaries and examples after each course very useful during the semester.  
      If I had to start over, I would take this course with better Java scripting and CSS background to have more options to add to my webpage, however for the start I am pleased with what I could do in a short period of time in this project. My overall experience with this course was very positive. The instructor was always available to help and the written summaries/examples after each course were very useful for better understanding.  
      The feedbacks were mostly on the appearance of the webpage, including a black rectangle appeared on top of the page that was removed. They suggested to remove the blue underlined title since they were not linked to any webpage. There was no explanation for the last figure in my webpage and I was asked to add a legend. There was also a suggestion about adding a captcha for contact us section to avoid machine generated messages, but I do not know how to add.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web design strategy that allows users to access to the main contents and functions of a website with any browser and any internet speed/bandwidth. It also provides enhanced version of the webpage when better browser or higher speed internet is available.
     PE (Progressive Enhancement) can be considered as a multilayer design built by HTML, CSS and JavaScript in separate layers. It uses HTML as the first layer, CSS as the second, and finally JavaScript as the last layer. A website designed with this strategy easily allows the websites to become enhanced depending on the web browserâ€™s capabilities. PE also help web designer to think what the core information are to be included in the content layer and what enhanced features are needed to be included for browsers that support them and whether an enhancement is even necessary or not.
